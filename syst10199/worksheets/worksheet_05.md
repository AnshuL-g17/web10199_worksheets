### W3 Consortium (specifications)

[W3C - HTML 5.3 - Section 4.10. Forms](http://w3c.github.io/html/sec-forms.html)  &mdash;
A form is a component of a Web page that has form controls, such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, range controls, 
or color pickers. A user can interact with such a form, providing data that can then be sent to the server for further 
processing (e.g., returning the results of a search or calculation). No client-side scripting is needed in many cases, 
though an API is available so that scripts can augment the user experience or use forms for purposes other than submitting 
data to a server.&hellip;</dd>
